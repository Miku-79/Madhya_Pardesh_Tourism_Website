        <p class="khajuraho-intro">
            Perched within the ancient walls of Gwalior Fort, the Sas Bahu temples are a remarkable monument to 11th-century 
            craftsmanship and architectural ingenuity. Despite their name suggesting a mother-in-law (Sas) and daughter-in-law 
            (Bahu) relationship, these twin temples are actually a linguistic corruption of "Sahastrabahu," referring to Lord 
            Vishnu's thousand arms. Constructed during the reign of King Mahipala of the Kachchhapaghata dynasty around 1093 CE, 
            these intricately carved temples showcase the pinnacle of medieval Hindu temple architecture and stand as a testament 
            to the artistic brilliance of their creators.

                <p class="box-content">
                    The Sas Bahu temples exemplify the North Indian Nagara style of temple architecture with their characteristic 
                    shikhara (spire) design. The complex consists of a larger temple (Sas) and a smaller adjacent temple (Bahu), 
                    both built on an elevated platform and connected by a common stairway. The temples feature a cruciform plan with 
                    protruding porches and mandapas (pillared halls) leading to the central sanctum. The meticulously carved stone 
                    exteriors display rhythmic projections and recesses that create dramatic play of light and shadow throughout the 
                    day, enhancing the visual appeal of these remarkable structures.

                <h3 class="box-title">Sculptural Magnificence</h3>
                <p class="box-content">
                    The true splendor of the Sas Bahu temples lies in their extraordinary sculptural details that adorn every 
                    available surface. The exterior walls feature intricately carved panels depicting various forms of Lord Vishnu, 
                    celestial beings (apsaras), mythological narratives, and geometric patterns. The temple ceilings are masterpieces 
                    of ornate lotus designs and concentric bands of decorative motifs. Particularly noteworthy are the beautifully 
                    carved doorways with elaborate makara toranas (crocodile arches) and the depictions of Vishnu's ten avatars (Dashavatar) 
                    that showcase the sculptor's exceptional skill in bringing stone to life.

                <h3 class="box-title">Historical Significance</h3>
                <p class="box-content">
                    Legend holds that the temples were constructed by King Mahipala for his mother and wife, who followed different 
                    religious paths—one devoted to Vishnu and the other to Shiva. This tale gives rise to the popular "Sas-Bahu" 
                    (mother-in-law and daughter-in-law) nomenclature. The temples bear Sanskrit inscriptions that provide valuable 
                    historical insights into the religious practices and royal patronage of the era. Despite facing considerable 
                    damage during foreign invasions in subsequent centuries, with their upper portions and central shikhara partially 
                    destroyed, the temples continue to stand as proud symbols of indigenous architectural and artistic traditions.

                <h3 class="box-title">Religious Symbolism</h3>
                <p class="box-content">
                    Originally dedicated to Lord Vishnu, the temples are rich in Vaishnavite symbolism and iconography. The central 
                    sanctum (now empty) once housed an image of Vishnu in his thousand-armed (Sahastrabahu) form. The walls feature 
                    various manifestations of the deity, including Varaha (boar incarnation) and Narasimha (man-lion incarnation). 
                    The temples also incorporate auspicious elements like the celestial musicians (gandharvas), divine maidens (apsaras), 
                    and mythical creatures that serve as guardians of the sacred space. The overall design follows traditional Hindu temple 
                    architecture principles, symbolizing the cosmic mountain (Mount Meru) and creating a sacred geography that connects 
                    the earthly realm with the divine.
