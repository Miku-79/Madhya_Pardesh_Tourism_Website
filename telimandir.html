        <h2 class="section-title">Architectural Wonder</h2>
        <p class="khajuraho-intro">
            Soaring to an impressive height of 100 feet, Teli Ka Mandir (Temple of the Oil Merchant) stands as one of the 
            tallest and most unique structures within Gwalior Fort. Built in the 9th century, this temple represents a 
            fascinating blend of North Indian Nagara and South Indian Dravidian architectural styles. Its distinctive 
            barrel-vaulted roof (wagon-vault), reminiscent of Dravidian gopurams, combined with typical North Indian 
            decorative elements, makes it an architectural anomaly and a testament to the cultural exchange that flourished 
            in medieval India.

                <h3 class="box-title">Unique Architecture</h3>
                <p class="box-content">
                    Teli Ka Mandir's most striking feature is its unusual shape and structure. Unlike the traditional 
                    shikhara (spire) found in most North Indian temples, it features a distinctive barrel-vaulted roof 
                    that creates a dramatic silhouette against the Gwalior skyline. The rectangular sanctum rises vertically 
                    before curving inward to form an arch at the top, resembling South Indian temple gateways. This hybrid 
                    design represents a rare architectural experiment that harmoniously combines elements from different 
                    regional styles, making it a unique specimen in Indian temple architecture.

                <h3 class="box-title">Exquisite Carvings</h3>
                <p class="box-content">
                    The exterior walls of Teli Ka Mandir are adorned with intricate sculptures and carvings that showcase 
                    the exceptional craftsmanship of medieval artisans. The temple features beautiful representations of 
                    river goddesses, various celestial beings, and decorative floral motifs. Particularly noteworthy are the 
                    sculptures of loving couples (mithuna figures) and the band of geometric patterns that run along the base 
                    of the structure. The doorway is elaborately decorated with garland-bearing figures, floral designs, and 
                    scenes from Hindu mythology, creating a visual narrative that welcomes devotees.

                <h3 class="box-title">Religious Significance</h3>
                <p class="box-content">
                    Originally dedicated to Lord Vishnu, the temple later became associated with Lord Shiva, as evidenced by 
                    the Garuda (Vishnu's mount) image on the lintel and a Shiva lingam that was once housed in the sanctum. 
                    This transition reflects the fluid nature of religious practices in medieval India. The temple's name, 
                    "Teli Ka Mandir," comes from a local legend that it was either built by or renovated with donations from 
                    a wealthy oil merchant (teli). Another interpretation suggests the name derives from being anointed with 
                    oil (tel) as part of ritual practices, highlighting its sacred importance in local worship traditions.

                <h3 class="box-title">Historical Journey</h3>
                <p class="box-content">
                    Throughout its thousand-year history, Teli Ka Mandir has witnessed numerous political changes and cultural 
                    transformations. It survived the Islamic invasions that damaged many other structures within Gwalior Fort, 
                    though it experienced periods of neglect. During the Mughal period, the temple's religious functions were 
                    temporarily suspended, and it was later restored under Maratha rule. The Archaeological Survey of India has 
                    undertaken significant conservation efforts to preserve this architectural treasure, allowing contemporary 
                    visitors to appreciate its historical and artistic significance within the context of India's rich cultural 
                    heritage.
