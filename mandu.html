        <h2 class="section-title">A Romance in Stone</h2>
        <p class="mandu-intro">
            Perched on a rocky outcrop about 2,000 feet above sea level, Mandu is a celebration of life and love. 
            The former capital of the Malwa Sultanate, this fortified medieval city is adorned with palaces, pavilions, 
            mosques, and tombs that tell stories of royal romance and architectural brilliance. The Afghan rulers who 
            governed Mandu were known for their passion for beauty and elegance, which is reflected in every structure 
            they built. With its lush greenery during monsoons and spectacular views of the surrounding countryside, 
            Mandu truly lives up to its nickname - "City of Joy."
        </p>

                <h3 class="box-title">Jahaz Mahal</h3>
                <p class="box-content">
                    The magnificent "Ship Palace" is perhaps Mandu's most iconic structure. Built between two artificial 
                    lakes, this elegant two-story palace appears to float like a ship when the lakes are full during monsoons. 
                    Constructed by Sultan Ghiyas-ud-din Khilji in the late 15th century, the palace served as a harem for 
                    the sultan's large retinue of wives and concubines. Its terraces, balconies, and open pavilions showcase 
                    the perfect blend of aesthetic beauty and functional design, with ingenious water systems that provided 
                    natural cooling during summer months and created a romantic ambiance for royal festivities.

                <h3 class="box-title">Rani Roopmati's Pavilion</h3>
                <p class="box-content">
                    Standing majestically on the southern edge of the plateau, Rani Roopmati's Pavilion offers breathtaking 
                    views of the Narmada Valley below. This elegant structure is intertwined with the legendary love story 
                    of Sultan Baz Bahadur and the beautiful singer Roopmati. Built as an army observation post, it later 
                    became the residence of Roopmati who could worship the sacred Narmada River from afar. The pavilion's 
                    architecture brilliantly combines elements of Rajasthani and Islamic styles, featuring domed chambers, 
                    open terraces, and an ingenious water harvesting system that captured rainwater for use throughout the year.

                <h3 class="box-title">Baz Bahadur's Palace</h3>
                <p class="box-content">
                    Built by the last independent ruler of Mandu, Sultan Baz Bahadur, this 16th-century palace stands as a 
                    testament to the sultan's love for architecture and his beloved Roopmati. The palace's design distinctly 
                    showcases the transition from Afghan to Mughal architecture. Its spacious courtyards, halls with arched 
                    entrances, and terraced gardens provide a glimpse into the grandeur of royal life during that era. The 
                    palace also housed a sophisticated water system that supplied water to various parts of the structure, 
                    including the beautiful fountains and baths that served as retreats during hot summer days.

                <h3 class="box-title">Jami Masjid</h3>
                <p class="box-content">
                    Inspired by the Great Mosque of Damascus, the Jami Masjid is one of India's finest examples of Afghan 
                    architecture. Begun by Hoshang Shah and completed in 1454 by Mahmud Khilji, this massive structure sits 
                    on a plinth of red sandstone and features a vast courtyard surrounded by colonnades. The prayer hall is 
                    adorned with intricate latticework, soaring domes, and elegant arches. Despite its grand scale, the mosque 
                    conveys a sense of serenity and harmony. The beautiful interplay of light and shadow created by its numerous 
                    domes and columned halls makes it a masterpiece of Islamic architectural design.
